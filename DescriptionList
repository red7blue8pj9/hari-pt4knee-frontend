Features matrix - This table layout makes clear that the information can be thought of as a two-dimensional numerical array or matrix, called the features matrix with shape [n_samples, n_features]

Target array.- In addition to the feature matrix X, we also generally work with a label or target array, which by convention we will usually call y. The target array is usually one dimensional, with length n_samples, and is generally contained in a NumPy array or Pandas Series.



Each value we are predicting is the response (also known as: target, outcome, label, dependent variable)

Classification is supervised learning in which the response is categorical




Requirements for working with data in scikit-learn

1) Features and response should be numeric

2)Features and response should have specific shapes
